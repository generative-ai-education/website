## Learning objectives

This course explores the transformative potential of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in the realms of teaching and learning. Students will engage with the latest advancements in generative AI technologies to understand their applications in automating content creation, personalizing learning materials, and fostering interactive and adaptive learning environments. Through lectures, hands-on projects, and research, participants will investigate how generative AI can make educational processes more efficient, accessible, and engaging.

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Understand the fundamental principles of generative AI and its relevance to education.
- Critically analyze the potential impacts of generative AI on traditional teaching and learning paradigms.
- Design and prototype innovative educational tools and approaches utilizing generative AI.
- Assess the ethical and practical considerations of implementing AI in educational settings.

## Late work policy

The due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material. However, I understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline. Here are the rules for late submissions:

-   Project taks may be submitted up to 2 days late. There will be a 25% deduction for each 24-hour period the project task is late.

If there are important circumstances that prevent you from completing a lab or homework assignment by the stated due date, you may email me at [kirenz@hdm-stuttgart.de](mailto:kirenz@hdm-stuttgart.de) before the deadline.
